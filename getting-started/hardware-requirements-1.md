# What will I need to take orders?

## GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION

Every aspect of the system runs online and therefore requires you to be connected to the internet to receive orders. Here are a few recommendations about how to set up your internet:

* Use your own internet connection instead of a shared connection so you have greater control
* Keep a 3G / 4G mobile internet connection as a backup in-case there is an interruption with your normal connection. Consider using your phone on hotspot mode for such instances.

## TABLET OR PHONE OR COMPUTER

To manage your online store and orders, you will need a device that can access the internet. We recommend using an android tablet with a table stand. You can purchase a tablet from us directly if you do not have and we will ship it to you for free within Canada.

## PRINTING INFO

{% hint style="info" %}
This is optional but very helpful for managing orders
{% endhint %}

You can automatically or manually print new orders using any printer whose drivers are installed on a Android device, Windows or Linux PC. To clarify, this means if you can print from an application like Word or Notepad, then it's compatible with our service. We highly recommend using a thermal receipt printer. The printers we recommend are Epson Bluetooth. We may also have a few printers in stock for purchase.  

We highly recommend using an Android device or Windows 10 tablet/computer. Windows provides the greatest flexibility and allows for wireless order printing whilst being able to use the order and table booking dashboard.

## WHICH PRINTER TO BUY?

You can use any printer with Windows or Linux drivers or any printer that works with ESCPOS using Android, so you are not restricted to just the printers we recommend.
